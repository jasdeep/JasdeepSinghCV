# CV with RMarkdown, Awesome CV LaTeX template and Google Sheets


This is a data driven Curriculum Vitae. An R script downloads and processes data entries from a Google Sheet. (h/t [`{datadrivencv}`](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/) by Nick Strayer).  It is built using the  [`{vitae}`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae)`::`[`{awesomecv}`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/reference/awesomecv.html) template.  
Some design elements have been taken from [`Yet Another Awesome CV`](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv) by Christope Roger. The data download functions are courtesy [Darwin Cubi](https://github.com/DarwinCV/automated-CV)
